I am PhD candidate at UC Santa Cruz researching the mechanisms underlying grassland restoration success. My first two chapters explores how drought influences the restoration of native grasslands and if we could improve establishment by selecting plants based on functional traits. I also found that native species outperformed the control group in drought in certain years leading me to explore competitive release experienced by native species from non-native invaders during drought. For my final and third chapter I seek to better understand long term restoration success. To do this I am surveying 32 restored coastal grasslands along a 1000km span ranging from 5 to 32 years post-planting or -seeding. Aside from vegetation surveys, I am also conducting detailed interviews and document analysis to determine what land managers and practitioners feel contribute to success and what the biggest limitations to achieving goals are. 

Aside from my dissertation research I am also interested in how restoration affects ecosystem functioning via insect habitat, soil nutrient cycling, especially carbon, and endophytic biotic interactions, all of which I have mentored undergraduates through independent research projects. I also have a keen interest in further exploring the use of local- versus climate-adapted seed genetics for restoration.

I am also a research affiliate at the Cheadle Center for Biodiversity and Ecological Restoration (CCBER) at UC Santa Barbara where I work on understanding the effects of restoration on insect communities. I serve on the Board of the California Native Grassland Association (CNGA) as a Director-at-Large and also am part of the active USFWS Nipomo Lupine Endangered Species Recovery Team.
