I am currently a PhD student at UC Santa Cruz researching the mechanisms underlying grassland restoration success using non-species specific functional trait framework in the context of drought and precipitation variability. Additionally, I will be working more on potential trade-offs incurred through restoration. A side project I have at Younger Lagoon Reserve will focus on potential trade offs in carbon storage, biodiversity and water infiltration. I am also interested in the overall sustainability and efficacy of ecological restoration and what causes some restoration projects to fail and others to succeed. 

Furthermore, I am a research affiliate at the Cheadle Center for Biodiversity and Ecological Restoration (CCBER) at UC Santa Barbara where I work on understanding the effects of restoration on insect communities, specifically Coccinellidae. If you think we have similar research interests and would like to collaborate on a project please feel free to contact me.
