      content: |
            Hello! My name is Cody Ellis, my pronouns are he/him, and I’m a senior Biology undergraduate with a concentration in Ecology. I’m interested in plant-soil-microbial dynamics and community ecology, especially in the context of host-associations and successional cycles. Growing up in the chaparral and bunchgrass prairie of southern Riverside county by the Santa Rosa plateau instilled in me a deep love for California’s endemic species and threatened habitats.  I’m excited to be part of the Luong lab this semester, working in ecological restoration for some of California’s most imperiled ecosystems! When I’m not helping in the lab or greenhouse, you can find me hiking at Big Lagoon or experimenting with natural dyes! My favorite organisms are *Stemonitis sp.* and the color rusty orange simply can’t be beat.
