            Hello! I'm Ernesto. I'm a natural resources graduate student. I'm broadly interested in  restoration, grasslands, plant ecology, botany, and ecosystem management. I grew up near the coast in Santa Barbara county where I developed an appreciation for spending time outside but I fell in love with grasslands, restoration, and fieldwork as an undergrad at UC Santa Cruz. When I'm not working, you can catch me hunting for wildflowers on iNat in the spring or cheffing it up at home. I'm also constantly trying out new hobbies! My favorite forbs are any and all heterotrophic plants, Lillies, and _Leptosyne gigantea_; my favorite grasses are _Danthonia californica_ and _Poa douglasii_.

            Hello! My name is Angelina and I am a Natural Resources graduate student planning to research secondary invasions under the guidance of Dr. Luong. Before pursuing my master’s degree, I attended Chico State and received a B.S. in Plant Biology. There, I was able to develop skills in both restoration and lab research. While working as a land steward at Big Chico Creek Ecological Reserve, I found a passion for rehabilitating native plant communities and was later able to connect that knowledge to my lab assistant position for the GRASS-Net project. My research interests include restoration ecology, soil health, invasive species physiology, and I hope to explore more ethnobotanical topics in the future! In my free time, I enjoy longboarding, cooking, practicing my plant identification, and bug hunting with friends. Some of my favorite plants include _Aquilegia formosa_, _Trifolium depauperatum_, and _Adiantum jordanii_.

            Growing up in the wilds of southern Appalachia on the VA/Tenn border I developed a love and respect for nature at a young age and have always sought to be an advocate for wild places and the species that depend on them.  Heading to college right out of high school and not knowing completely what field to go into, I earned a BA in Interdisciplinary Studies from Virginia Tech in 2003.  I quickly fell in love with field biology and research, working a series of seasonal jobs, knowing my true passion was for plants, plant communities, and ecosystems.  In 2005 I found myself in Humboldt County working with the Northern Spotted Owl and earned a BS in Botany from Humboldt State University in 2008.  I have been working for the Wiyot Tribe as their botanist and Natural Resources Director since 2014, and seek to apply the knowledge I’ve learned toward the protection of ethnobotanical sites and Tribal cultural resources, lobbying for the reinstitution of indigenous land management and the application of traditional ecological knowledge in natural resources management.  I enjoy spending time out in nature with my wonderful daughters Iris and Azalea, backpacking, botanizing, and playing the banjo.

            Hello! My name is Lee. I'm a first-year natural resources grad student here. I grew up in New Jersey and have spent nearly all of my academic and professional career there, graduating from Rutgers University with a degree in Ecology, Evolution, and Natural Resources in 2017. I have a wide variety of interests in ecology and I'm fortunate to have been able to work in roles that allowed me to explore all of those interests from songbird point counts and banding to assessing forest plant communities, rare plant surveys, fire ecology, and the applications of terrestrial LiDAR. In my spare time I love hiking, mountain biking, and looking for cool plants and birds along the way. I’m still getting to know the California flora, so my favorite plants are from back home in the east, but my favorite forb is _Anemonoides quinquefolia_ and my favorite grass is _Elymus hystrix_.
