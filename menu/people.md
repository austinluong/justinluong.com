Hello! I am the Lab Technician for the Luong Lab. I'm passionate about education and science communication. I love to dance and my favorite holiday is Halloween. I grew up not too far from here in the Trinity Alps whish is where I first developed a love of ecology. I graduated from UC Santa Cruz in 2022 with my BA in Environmental Studies and Community studies. During my time there I worked witht the Sustainability Office and I wrote my senior thesis on the importance of anti-racism in envirnmental non-profits. Feel free to say hello if you see me around!

## Logan Holey 
I'm a full time student studying the management of rangelands at California Polytechnic University Humboldt. I focus on the development of sustainable rangeland management practices with an emphasis on soil health and native plant communities. I strive to restore rangeland ecosystems through native plant and soil restoration and the implementation of practices that allow the symbiotic relationship between humans and the land to return.
