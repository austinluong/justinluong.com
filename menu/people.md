            Dr. Luong is an Assistant Professor of Rangeland Resource Science in the Forestry, Fire, and Rangeland Department at Cal Poly Humboldt, where he works     with rangeland ecosystems, particularly in conservation and ecological restoration of California habitats, focused but not limited to grasslands with direct land manager engagement. His research interests center around climate-ready and invasion resistant restoration practices and incorporating management perspectives to understand restoration outcomes. Dr. Luong is particularly dedicated to promoting multi-use landscapes that balance range productivity and conserve native plant biodiversity. Dr. Luong completed his Bachelor's at the University of California (UC) Santa Barbara, and worked as an undergraduate researcher in the D'Antonio lab. He earned his PhD at UC Santa Cruz working with Dr. Michael Loik and Dr. Karen Holl in the Environmental Studies Department and worked as a USDA postdoctoral researcher at UC Davis with Dr. Jennifer Funk. Prior, Dr. Luong worked as a restoration coordinator at The Cheadle Center for Biodiversity and Ecological Restoration. Dr. Luong actively currently contributes to the broader conservation community through various leadership positions in various professional societies and advisory committees and serves as a board member and the Science and Education Committee Chair of the California Native Grassland Association. Dr. Luong is deeply invested in mentorship and actively fosters the growth of aspiring ecologists and works to train undergraduate and masters students. My favorite grasses are _Festuca californica_ and _Danthonia californica_.

            Hello! I'm Ernesto. I'm a natural resources graduate student. I'm broadly interested in  restoration, grasslands, plant ecology, botany, and ecosystem management. I grew up near the coast in Santa Barbara county where I developed an appreciation for spending time outside but I fell in love with grasslands, restoration, and fieldwork as an undergrad at UC Santa Cruz. When I'm not working, you can catch me hunting for wildflowers on iNat in the spring or cheffing it up at home. I'm also constantly trying out new hobbies! My favorite forbs are any and all heterotrophic plants, Lillies, and _Leptosyne gigantea_; my favorite grasses are _Danthonia californica_ and _Poa douglasii_.

            Hello, my name is Tonia. I use they/them pronouns and I am the lab/field tech for the Luong Lab. I'm passionate about education, dancing and my favorite holiday is Halloween. I grew up not far from Humboldt in the Trinity Alps which is where I learned to love plants. Before moving to Arcata in August 2023, I graduated in 2022 from UC Santa Cruz with my BA in Environmental Studies and Community Studies. During my time there I worked with the Sustainability Office and I wrote my senior thesis on the importance of anti-racism in envrionmental non-profits. I love working with others and meeting new people so if you see me around, feel free to say hi!

            Hi, my name is Gabriel Abundis. I am a third-year majoring in rangeland resources with a minor in botany and soils. I am from southern California and although I grew up with nature, I never truly appreciated it for what it is. I fell in love with rangelands and their role in supporting ecosystems. Currently my research focuses intently on exploring the intricate dynamics between photovoltaic cells and the delicate coastal California grasslands. I am particularly interested in the forage value of species, and holistic approaches for rangeland management. When I am not in lab, I enjoy taking my dogs on adventures and eating/cooking.

            Hello! My name is Claudia Alfaro Hernandez (She/Her/Hers pronouns) and I’m a student assistant in the Luong lab. I’m an Environmental Science & Management major with a concentration in Ecological Restoration and a double minor in Geospatial Analysis and Wildland Soil Science. Before coming to Humboldt County in 2020, I was originally from Southern California, specifically Jurupa Valley (Inland Empire region). Before working with Dr. Justin Luong in his lab, I was a Soil Science Trainee with the NRCS Soil Survey assisting soil scientists with plant identification and soil analysis. I am very excited to have the opportunity to work within the Luong lab this semester, as it allows me to practice my strengths within soil science, correlating its impacts on plant communities regarding sustainable land use applications. When I’m not in the Luong lab, you can find me on the nearby beaches paddleboarding, tide pooling, birding, and beachcombing.

            Hi, my name is Sage (she/her) and I’m a third-year Rangeland Resource Science major. I’m from Southern California originally where I grew up hiking, camping, and working outdoors. I’ll always have a soft spot for coastal grass and shrublands. I’m interested in range conservation particularly with wildlife, invasives, and urban sprawl. In my free time I like to collage, garden, sketch, create fiber art, I am Vice President of the Range & Soils Club, and I’m on the logging sports team. Unsurprisingly, I’m a big fan of North American sages!

            Hello! My name is Cody Ellis, my pronouns are he/him, and I’m a senior Biology undergraduate with a concentration in Ecology. I’m interested in plant-soil-microbial dynamics and community ecology, especially in the context of host-associations and successional cycles. Growing up in the chaparral and bunchgrass prairie of southern Riverside county by the Santa Rosa plateau instilled in me a deep love for California’s endemic species and threatened habitats.  I’m excited to be part of the Luong lab this semester, working in ecological restoration for some of California’s most imperiled ecosystems! When I’m not helping in the lab or greenhouse, you can find me hiking at Big Lagoon or experimenting with natural dyes! My favorite organisms are *Stemonitis sp.* and the color rusty orange simply can’t be beat.

            I am a post-baccalaureate student in the Rangeland Resource Science program at Cal Poly Humboldt. Prior to returning to school, I worked as a sustainability consultant where I learned about resource management in the built environment. While working on large-scale waste management studies I became interested in learning about natural resource management. While pursuing my second bachelor’s degree I interned for NRCS Idaho and competed on the Collegiate Soil Judging team. My research project is focused on understanding the ecological conditions which may influence _Pleuropogon hooverianus_ development.

            Hi, I am Ashley and I'm a Rangeland Resource Science major with a Minor in Botany. Some of my hobbies include enjoying anything outdoors including foraging, hiking, camping, and pressing plants. I also really enjoy journaling, scrapbooking/creating collages, and thrifting. In the future it would be really cool work in land conservation/ and or conducting plant surveys for government agencies. I have a passion for plants and I really enjoy learning new plant species everyday.

            I am a full time student studying the management of rangelands at California Polytechnic University Humboldt. I focus on the development of sustainable rangeland management practices with an emphasis on soil health and native plant communities. I strive to restore rangeland ecosystems through native plant and soil restoration and the implementation of practices that allow the symbiotic relationship between humans and the land to return.
