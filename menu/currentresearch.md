## Ongoing Research Projects
----------
**Functional Traits and Grassland Restoration**

* Exploring the effect of drought related functional traits in explaining restoration outcomes in the context of drought
* Restoration experiment in the context of the International Drought Experiment
* Enormous amounts of money are spent on restoration annually, however, restoration outcomes are still unpredictable and often poorly understood

**Does *Stipa pulchra* (Poaceae) exhibit local adaptation?**

* Collaborative project with Maddie Nolan (UCSB) and Justin Valliere (UCLA)
* Compares whether *Stipa pulchra* (purple needle grass), a commonly used grassland species in restoration, exhibits local adaptation based on seed provenance
* Compares survival, reproductive potential and a functional trait of 7 localities of seeds at 3 different gardens along a latitudinal gradient


**The effects of grassland restoration on Lady Beetle (Coleoptera: Coccinellidae) community assemblages**

* Restoration often touts that it is multi-purposed and positively affects the biodiversity at multiple trophic levels however, little work is done on understanding how insect communities may change after restoration
* We targeted Coccinellids due their importance economically due to agricultural production and because there are known species within the family that are known to be invasive
* Collections are targeted at restored, non-restored and remnant sites that were used as restoration reference sites 


**The long-term influence of microhabitat factors in establishing the endangered Nipomo Lupine (Fabaceae: *Lupinus nipomensis*)**

* Studies have found that a majority of rare and endangered plant establishment efforts have failed due to an incomplete knowledge base of habitat preferences.
* An outplanting experiment was started in 2015 using 2880 Nipomo Lupine seeds in a variety of microhabitats
* Long-term monitoring is taking place to determine the role of microhabitats in sustainable establishment of endangered species as ecological trends are often not visible for several years
* Factors include abiotic conditions and some potential biotic interactions
