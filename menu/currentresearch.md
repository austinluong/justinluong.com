         * Ecological restoration has been documented as a management action since the 1980s.  
         * Outcomes are often not assessed, especially past intial implementation.  
         * I surveyed 37 restored coastal grasslands over from 2019-2021 to compare the vegetation data 
           against project-based goals from project documents and management interviews, and against a standard 
           performance metric.  
         * I am especially interested in understanding why certain projects are more successful than other, 
           the effect of time, and interannual variability.

          * Global change is rapidly resulting in novel temperatures and preciptation patterns and increased nitrogen
            deposition and species invasion.  
          * I work towards understanding how global change factors, especially drought, influence restoration outcomes
            and the utility of the functional traits for understanding community change and plant selection.  
          * Use both physiological and morphological plant approaches in manipulative and observational field studies 
            and controlled greenhouse environments.  
          * I integrate functional and phylogenetic diversity metrics to better understand the impacts of restoration and
            global change on different metrics of biodiversity.

          * The dominant restoration paradigm encourages that practitioners only use "locally" sourced plants because
            they may have evolved relative fitness benefits compared to non-local populations.
          * However, recent reviews found only half of plants tested are actually locally adapted, less than previously 
            thought. And with climate change locally adaptated populations may no longer be best suited for local restoration.
          * I am currently working in collaborations to assess the presence of local adaptation in commonly used restoration species:
            *Stipa pulchra* and *Eschscholzia californica* in multi-sited common gardens, and in response to greenhouse fog manipulations

          * Restoration often touts that it is multi-purposed and positively affects the biodiversity at multiple
            trophic levels however, little work is done on understanding how insect communities may change after
            restoration
          * I work to understand how restoration affects insect communities and am currently focusing on coccinellids
          * I am currently working to understand how mid-term grassland restoration affects soil carbon

          * Studies have found that a majority of rare and endangered plant establishment efforts have failed due to an
            incomplete knowledge base of habitat preferences.
          * An outplanting experiment was started in 2015 and two others in 2019.
          * Long-term monitoring is taking place to determine the role of microhabitats in sustainable establishment of
            endangered species as ecological trends are often not visible for several years
          * Factors include abiotic conditions (aspect, slope, precipitation, temperature) and biotic interactions (competition, pollinator limitation, plant herbivores)
