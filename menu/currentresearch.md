         Ecological restoration has been documented as a management action since the 1980s, yet there are limited efforts to assess outcomes, especially past intial implementation. To better understand how restoration efforts are faring, we surveyed 37 restored coastal grasslands over the past three years to compare the vegetation data against project-based goals from original documents and management interviews, and against a standard performance metric. I'm especially interested in understanding why certain projects are more successful than other, the effect of time, and interannual variability.

          * Collaborative project with Maddie Nolan (UCSB) and Justin Valliere (UCLA)
          * Compares whether *Stipa pulchra* (purple needle grass), a commonly used grassland species in restoration,
            exhibits local adaptation based on seed provenance
          * Compares survival, reproductive potential and a functional trait of 7 localities of seeds at 3 different
            gardens along a latitudinal gradient

          * Restoration often touts that it is multi-purposed and positively affects the biodiversity at multiple
            trophic levels however, little work is done on understanding how insect communities may change after
            restoration
          * We targeted Coccinellids due their importance economically due to agricultural production and because
            there are known species within the family that are known to be invasive
          * Collections are targeted at restored, non-restored and remnant sites that were used as restoration
            reference sites

      *Lupinus nipomensis*)"

          * Studies have found that a majority of rare and endangered plant establishment efforts have failed due to an
            incomplete knowledge base of habitat preferences.
          * An outplanting experiment was started in 2015 using 2880 Nipomo Lupine seeds in a variety of microhabitats
          * Long-term monitoring is taking place to determine the role of microhabitats in sustainable establishment of
            endangered species as ecological trends are often not visible for several years
          * Factors include abiotic conditions and some potential biotic interactions
