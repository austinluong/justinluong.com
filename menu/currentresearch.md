          * Cattle production is one of California's most dominant industries.  
          * We are interested in how grazing effects native grassland and wetland plant species in the small Northern California town of Willits California.
          * We will condusct vegetation surveys in grazed and ungrazed plots on the site managed by the Mendocino County Resource Conservation District. We will also monitor hydrology and review data found in 10              year of environmental impact reports in response to a highway bypass that was build on the site. 
          * There are criticially endangered species on the site such as North Coast Semaphore Grass or _Pleuropogon hooverianus_ and Baker's Meadowfoam or _Limnanthes bakerii.__

          * Ecological restoration has been documented as a management action since the 1980s.  
          * Outcomes are often not assessed, especially past intial implementation.  
          * I surveyed 37 restored coastal grasslands over from 2019-2021 to compare the vegetation data 
           against project-based goals from project documents and management interviews, and against a standard 
           performance metric.  
          * I am especially interested in understanding why certain projects are more successful than other, 
            the effect of time, and interannual variability.

          * Global change is rapidly resulting in novel temperatures and precipitation patterns and increased nitrogen
            deposition and species invasion.  
          * I work towards understanding how global change factors, especially drought, influence restoration outcomes
            and the utility of the functional traits for understanding community change and plant selection.  
          * Use both physiological and morphological plant approaches in manipulative and observational field studies 
            and controlled greenhouse environments.  
          * I integrate functional and phylogenetic diversity metrics to better understand the impacts of restoration and
            global change on different metrics of biodiversity.

          * The dominant restoration paradigm encourages that practitioners only use "locally" sourced plants because
            they may have evolved relative fitness benefits compared to non-local populations.
          * However, recent reviews found only half of plants tested are actually locally adapted, less than previously 
            thought. And with climate change locally adaptated populations may no longer be best suited for local restoration.
          * I am currently working in collaborations to assess the presence of local adaptation in commonly used restoration species:
            *Stipa pulchra* and *Eschscholzia californica* in multi-sited common gardens, and in response to greenhouse fog manipulations

      content: |
          * We hope to collect samples and measure plant traits to inform why certain plants tend to survive, or not, around solar panels.
          * This project is predominantly planned and led by undergraduate students from diverse backgrounds who are hired under a work study internship program. This project provides ecological research training             to inform plant viability for future grazing, agriculture, or pollinator gardens under or near solar panels. 
          * Renewable energy will continue to be a part of our future. Itâ€™s in our interest to understand the impacts that solar panel microgrids can have on landscapes, and especially rangelands because they are             crucial California ecosystems.

          * Restoration indicates that it is multi-purposed and positively affects the biodiversity at multiple
            trophic levels and ecosystem functioning, but is rarely assessed
          * I work to understand how restoration affects insect communities and am currently focusing on coccinellids
          * I am currently working to understand how mid-term grassland restoration affects soil carbon

          * Studies have found that a majority of rare and endangered plant establishment efforts have failed due to an
            incomplete knowledge base of habitat preferences.
          * An outplanting experiment was started in 2015 and two others in 2019.
          * Long-term monitoring is taking place to determine the role of microhabitats in sustainable establishment of
            endangered species as ecological trends are often not visible for several years
          * Factors include abiotic conditions (aspect, slope, precipitation, temperature) and biotic interactions (competition, pollinator limitation, plant herbivores)
