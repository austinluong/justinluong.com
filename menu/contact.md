If you are interested in hearing more about any of my research, or think that you may want to collaborate on a future or current project do not hesitate to contact me ([justin.luong@humboldt.edu](mailto:justin.luong@humboldt.edu)). The Lab will not be accepting any new graduate students until Spring 2026.
