            I am a post-baccalaureate student in the Rangeland Resource Science program at Cal Poly Humboldt. Prior to returning to school, I worked as a sustainability consultant where I learned about resource management in the built environment. While working on large-scale waste management studies I became interested in learning about natural resource management. While pursuing my second bachelorâ€™s degree I interned for NRCS Idaho and competed on the Collegiate Soil Judging team. My research project is focused on understanding the ecological conditions which may influence _Pleuropogon hooverianus_ development.

            Hi, I am Ashley and I'm a Rangeland Resource Science major with a Minor in Botany. Some of my hobbies include enjoying anything outdoors including foraging, hiking, camping, and pressing plants. I also really enjoy journaling, scrapbooking/creating collages, and thrifting. In the future it would be really cool work in land conservation/ and or conducting plant surveys for government agencies. I have a passion for plants and I really enjoy learning new plant species everyday.
