            I am a post-baccalaureate student in the Rangeland Resource Science program at Cal Poly Humboldt. Prior to returning to school, I worked as a sustainability consultant where I learned about resource management in the built environment. While working on large-scale waste management studies I became interested in learning about natural resource management. While pursuing my second bachelorâ€™s degree I interned for NRCS Idaho and competed on the Collegiate Soil Judging team. My research project is focused on understanding the ecological conditions which may influence _Pleuropogon hooverianus_ development.

            Hi! My name is Hazel Goode. I am a Botany Student minoring in Wildland Soils in my final year at Humboldt. I grew up in the foothills of the Sierra Nevadas and have always loved being outside. I became interested in rangelands working alongside a Rangeland Specialist/ Botanist for the Tahoe National Forest and have come to deeply appreciate their beauty and diversity. In my free time I love to kayak, create art, and spend time in the woods. My favorite gramminoid is _Carex utriculata_!

            Hi, I am Ashley and I'm a Rangeland Resource Science major with a Minor in Botany. Some of my hobbies include enjoying anything outdoors including foraging, hiking, camping, and pressing plants. I also really enjoy journaling, scrapbooking/creating collages, and thrifting. In the future it would be really cool work in land conservation/ and or conducting plant surveys for government agencies. I have a passion for plants and I really enjoy learning new plant species everyday.
