## Current lab members 

**Logan Holey**
*Lab Assistant*
![Logan Holey](Logan.jpg)
I am a full time student studying the management of rangelands at California Polytechnic University Humboldt. I focus on the development of sustainable rangeland management practices with an emphasis on soil health and native plant communities. I strive to restore rangeland ecosystems through native plant and soil restoration and the implementation of practices that allow the symbiotic relationship between humans and the land to return.

**Cody Ellis**
*Lab Assistant*

Hello! My name is Cody Ellis, my pronouns are he/him, and I’m a senior Biology undergraduate with a concentration in Ecology. I’m interested in plant-soil-microbial dynamics and community ecology, especially in the context of host-associations and successional cycles. Growing up in the chaparral and bunchgrass prairie of southern Riverside county by the Santa Rosa plateau instilled in me a deep love for California’s endemic species and threatened habitats.  I’m excited to be part of the Luong lab this semester, working in ecological restoration for some of California’s most imperiled ecosystems! When I’m not helping in the lab or greenhouse, you can find me hiking at Big Lagoon or experimenting with natural dyes! My favorite organisms are *Stemonitis sp.* and the color rusty orange simply can’t be beat. 

**Tonia Brito-Bersi**
*Lab Technician*

Hello, my name is Tonia. I use they/them pronouns and I am the lab/feild tech for the Luong Lab. I'm passionate about education, dancing and my favorite holiday is Halloween. I grew up not far from Humboldt in the Trinity Alps which is where I learned to love plants. Before moving to Arcata in August 2023, I graduated in 2022 from UC Santa Cruz with my BA in Environmentals Studies and Community Studies. During my time there I worked with the Sustainability Office and I wrote my senior thesis on the importance of anti-racism in envrionmental non-profits. I love working with others and meeting new people so if you see me around, feel free to say hi!
