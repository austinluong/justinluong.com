          Dr. Luong is an Assistant Professor of Rangeland Resource Science in the Forestry, Fire, and Rangeland Department at Cal Poly Humboldt, where he works with rangeland ecosystems, particularly in conservation and ecological restoration of California habitats, focused but not limited to grasslands with direct land manager engagement. His research interests center around climate-ready and invasion resistant restoration practices and incorporating management perspectives to understand restoration outcomes. Dr. Luong is particularly dedicated to promoting multi-use landscapes that balance range productivity and conserve native plant biodiversity. Dr. Luong completed his Bachelor's at the University of California (UC) Santa Barbara, and worked as an undergraduate researcher in the D'Antonio lab. He earned his PhD at UC Santa Cruz working with Dr. Michael Loik and Dr. Karen Holl in the Environmental Studies Department and worked as a USDA postdoctoral researcher at UC Davis with Dr. Jennifer Funk. Prior, Dr. Luong worked as a restoration coordinator at The Cheadle Center for Biodiversity and Ecological Restoration. Dr. Luong actively currently contributes to the broader conservation community through various leadership positions in various professional societies and advisory committees and serves as a board member and the Science and Education Committee Chair of the California Native Grassland Association. Dr. Luong is deeply invested in mentorship and actively fosters the growth of aspiring ecologists and works to train undergraduate and masters students.

          Hello, my name is Tonia. I use they/them pronouns and I am the lab/feild tech for the Luong Lab. I'm passionate about education, dancing and my favorite holiday is Halloween. I grew up not far from Humboldt in the Trinity Alps which is where I learned to love plants. Before moving to Arcata in August 2023, I graduated in 2022 from UC Santa Cruz with my BA in Environmentals Studies and Community Studies. During my time there I worked with the Sustainability Office and I wrote my senior thesis on the importance of anti-racism in envrionmental non-profits. I love working with others and meeting new people so if you see me around, feel free to say hi!

          I am a full time student studying the management of rangelands at California Polytechnic University Humboldt. I focus on the development of sustainable rangeland management practices with an emphasis on soil health and native plant communities. I strive to restore rangeland ecosystems through native plant and soil restoration and the implementation of practices that allow the symbiotic relationship between humans and the land to return.

          Hello! My name is Cody Ellis, my pronouns are he/him, and I’m a senior Biology undergraduate with a concentration in Ecology. I’m interested in plant-soil-microbial dynamics and community ecology, especially in the context of host-associations and successional cycles. Growing up in the chaparral and bunchgrass prairie of southern Riverside county by the Santa Rosa plateau instilled in me a deep love for California’s endemic species and threatened habitats.  I’m excited to be part of the Luong lab this semester, working in ecological restoration for some of California’s most imperiled ecosystems! When I’m not helping in the lab or greenhouse, you can find me hiking at Big Lagoon or experimenting with natural dyes! My favorite organisms are *Stemonitis sp.* and the color rusty orange simply can’t be beat.
