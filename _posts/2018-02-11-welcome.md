I am currently a PhD student at UC Santa Cruz researching the mechanisms underlying grassland restoration success using non-species specific measures such as functional in the context of environmental change such as drought variability. Furthermore, I am an research affiliate at the UC Santa Barbara, where I work on understanding the effects of restoration on arthropod, specifically Lady Beetle, communities. If you think we have similar research interests and would like to collaborate on a project please feel free to contact me.
