I am currently a PhD student at UC Santa Cruz researching the mechanisms underlying grassland restoration success using non-species specific functional trait framework in the context of drought and precipitation variability. Furthermore, I am a research affiliate at the Cheadle Center for Biodiversity and Ecological Restoration (CCBER) at UC Santa Barbara. There I work on understanding the effects of restoration on insect communities, specifically Coccinellidae. If you think we have similar research interests and would like to collaborate on a project please feel free to contact me.
